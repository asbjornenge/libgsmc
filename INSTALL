Documentation can be found in the header file "gsmc.h", the src/README
file, or online at:

1. Quick build instructions, for the documentation challenged:
	./configure && make install

This will build a library which is native to your host. To test out
your build:
	sudo make check

To build using a cross-compiler, you need to make certain your compiler
is in your PATH variable. E.g., if you use the bash shell, give this command:
	export PATH=/usr/local/arm/3.4.1/bin:$PATH

Then run configure with the following option:
	./configure --host arm-linux-gcc
	make install

By default, this will install the library in /usr/local/lib. To change
the default installation directory, type `configure --help`

To use this library when building your application, do one of the following:
	- add LIBDIR to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
		during execution

	- add LIBDIR to the `LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable during linking

	- use the `-Wl,--rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag

	- have your system administrator add LIBDIR to `/etc/ld.so.conf'


2. Cross tools

Prebuilt cross toolchains are available at:
	http://handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/PrebuiltToolchains

3. Prebuilt binaries
 
If you don't want the hassle of compiling the library yourself there's
a precompiled-arm library available on the libgsmc website:
	http://libgsmc.hanafjedle.net

Or from:
	http://supercomputer.org/libgmsmc

4. autoconf maintainers

Developers of libgsmc may, from time to time, want to tweak the autoconf
structure in order to better support different architectures. If you want 
to modify the autoconf files, the Makefile.autoconf can be used. To build 
the configure and other scripts, just do:

	make -f Makefile.autoconf distclean
	make -f Makefile.autoconf configure
	make -f Makefile.autoconf clean

The "distclean" target will remove all the autoconf generated files 
allow you to start from scratch. 

After the files have been modified and tested, repeat the first two steps,
and then generate the appropriate patch file.
