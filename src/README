This directory contains the source code for the libgsmc library. This README
is intended to give you an overview of how the code is structured, as well as 
to provide documentation on how to add support for a new GSM module.

libgsmc is an implementation of the ETSI 07.07 standard for GSM modems
(the specification is available free of charge at www.etsi.org).

So the starting place here is the file etsi707.h. This include file describes 
the main data structures which serve as the foundation for the entire codebase.

In particular, is the etsi_07_07 structure. This serves two purposes.
First, it provides a reference for every possible feature listed in the
ETSI standard. Second, it provides the framework needed to access any
given ETSI supported functionality in your modem.

Each element in the etsi_07_07 structure is a pointer a structure which
defines the data needed to implement the specific functionality of the standard.

For example, the CHUP element is available if you want to implement Call Hangup
support (which is a basic requirement of all phones).

The ETSI 7.07 standard is based on a simple command-response finite state
machine. Consequently, each of the etsi_07_07 data elements is a pointer to
a structure which implements the FSM for the command.

The Finite State Machine (FSM) for each command is described by a GCR structure. 
2. Adding a support for a new GSM modem.

In short, one should just take an existing file (like generic.c) and 
modify it for your GSM chip. Currently, the most advanced support is
in the telit.c file. You can also start with this, and modify the 
addresses of the routines appropriately.
