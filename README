libgsmc is a GSM Communications library intended to be used as a foundation
for phone applications on linux based handheld mobile phones. A working 
phone isn't required as support for a GSM emulator is provided.

Quick start:
	sh configure && make

This will produce the library ./src/libgsmc.la. You can then use this 
library to develop your source code. Example applications, and the GSM 
emulator, are automatically built within the ./examples subdirector.

To test your build:
	sudo make check

To install this library, just do a `make install`.

The project was created by Asbjorn Andersen aka m1nd in the spring of 2006
for his final bachelor paper at the University of Stavanger, Norway.
 
For information about and documentation on how to use this library check out
