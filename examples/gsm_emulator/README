This directory contains the source code for the gsm_emulator, which is
a program that emulates different types of GSM modems. 

To use it, just start it. It will report which terminal device that it is
listening to. E.g.: 
	./gsm_emulator
	Psuedo Modem is on device: /dev/pts/15

Once you see this output, any program can now talk /dev/pts/15 and will
receive an appropriate ETSI response whenever an ETSI modem command is
given. E.g.:
	Sending an "AT" string will result in an "OK" string being returned.

One can even use minicom, kermit, tip, et. al., to talk to this emulated
modem.

The gsm_emulator is not only used by the examples, but also by the testsuite.
Thus, it must be built before either will work.

To increase the number of debug messages output by gsm_emulator, just
send a `killall -s USR1 gsm_emulator `. To decrease it, send a 
`killall -s USR2 gsm_emulator`. The emulator will pick up the message, 
and increase/decrease the level of verbosity for output. Each kill signal 
changes the level by 1.

You will see an error message from the gsm_emulator, related to the select(2)
call. This can be ignored. Currently it's deliberately not being handled,
for example purposes. What one does with it is really application specific.
