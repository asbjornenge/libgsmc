This directory contains the source code for various examples of how to use
libgsmc. These examples are:

	cli:		A simple command-line interface for making a call.

	gsm_emulator:	A daemon process which emulates different types of
			GSM modems. 

	qt:		Under development. This is where examples of using
			Trolltech's Qt framework will go.

Note well: 
	The gsm_emulator is not only used by the examples, but also by the 
	testsuite. Thus, it must be built before either will work.
