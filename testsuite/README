This directory contains the tests for libgsmc. In order to run the
entire suite by hand, one simply issues the command:
	
	runtest

This assumes that the GNU testing framework "dejagnu" is installed on 
your system (it comes with many Linux distros by default, as DejaGNU is
a part of many core GNU utilities).

The tests here are divided into the following categories:
	./basic: 	These tests primarily insure that your system
			is set up properly. If your system is misconfigured
			(E.g. kermit isn't installed), the rest of the tests
			won't work.

	./section8:	These are tests of Section 8 of the ETSI specification.

References:
The best quick dejagnu reference is in example/hello/README of the
dejagnu source tree.

NOTE WELL: This suite uses kermit, and on many Linux distros, kermit has
	problems. In short, the locking mechanism is ancient, and typically
	requires you to violate standard security policies.

	The simplest solution is to just run this suite as root.
	The proper solution is to fix kermit so that one can just issue
	the following simple command as a normal user:
	
	"kermit -l /dev/pts/20 -b 38400"

	The proper solution is to fix the kermit source code, but that's
	unlikely to happen.
